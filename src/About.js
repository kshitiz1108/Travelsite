        Free-writing, developed by Peter Elbow in the 1970s, steps beyond traditional brainstorming lists
         to put pen to paper and write sentences and paragraphs without stopping. Elbow suggests free-
         writing for a few minutes, selecting a word or idea from the text, and using that word or idea
          for a new free-write that extends for several minutes.
