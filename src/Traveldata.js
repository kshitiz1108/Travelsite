        place:"Mont Saint-Michel: Normandy, France",
        description:"This medieval Benedictine monastery is one of the most spectacular sights in Europe. Dating back to the eighth century, Mont-Saint-Michel sits atop an island in the bay that Brittany and Normandy share. Visitors can reach the abbey on foot or by shuttle bus from the car parks or book a special maringote (horse-drawn carriage). For a treat, stay on the island and enjoy a world-renowned omelet at La Mère Poulard or seek out Normandy specialties such as crepes and galettes. Be sure to sample Calvados, an apple brandy that is only produced in the Normandy region.",

        place:"Victoria Falls: Zimbabwe and Zambia",
        description:"Victoria Falls is the largest waterfall in the world, measuring at more than a mile wide with water that tumbles over several edges at up to 500 million liters per minute. This natural landmark – one of the top places to visit in Africa – is located on the Zambezi River between Zimbabwe and Zambia. The falls, once described by a local tribe as the smoke that thunders, plunge to a maximum drop of about 350 feet into the gorge below. You can book a day tour from the Zimbabwe town of Victoria Falls or visit the falls on your own (with an entrance fee). There are several viewing spots that offer excellent vantage points for Victoria Falls, including the Main Falls in Zimbabwe and the Knife Edge Bridge in Zambia. If you're lucky, you may even see a lunar rainbow, or moonbow, over the falls between February and August when the river is at its highest. Victoria Falls is one of a handful of places on Earth that boasts this phenomenon.",
